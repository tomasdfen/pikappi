## Pikappi

Pikappi is an application that consists of a Pokémon game where we can capture Pokémons through a Quizz-style game, depending on the percentage of success in this minigame the user will have more or less opportunities to capture the wild appeared Pokémon. Once captured, it will be registered in our Pokédex,
which is like a library where the user archive data of captured pokémons. The user can also personify his profile.
