# Pikappi

Pikappi is an application that consists of a Pokémon game where we can capture Pokémons through a Quizz-style game, depending on the percentage of success in this minigame the user will have more or less opportunities to capture the wild appeared Pokémon. Once captured, it will be registered in our Pokédex, which is like a library where the user archive data of captured pokémons. The user can also personify his profile.

## Home Page
On our home screen we can see all the buttons and routes to the other screens, apart from our favorite pokémon, which will change depending on the pokémon we choose to accompany us. The accesible buttons are: the settings page, the quizz minigame and the Pokédex respectively. At the top right we will find a button with an avatar of our chosen coach that will take us to the user settings.

## Settings Page
It takes care of system settings and some options. This was a sample page for mere training with Flutter so a few have little functionality. The two buttons that we can actually interact with are those for music and notifications.

The first button is simply to choose if we want to listen to background music. The other option is to receive notifications, as soon as you activate this option, a notification will appear alerting us that the option to receive notifications from the game has been activated, and every day a local notification will appear on the phone reminding us to play.
